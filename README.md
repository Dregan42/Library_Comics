#Library_Comics

Here I will post how the project is going and what I want to implement in it.

***Project status :***

At this moment the program do not work. I just wanted to upload it to see how it works.

***Project principle :*** 

I wanted a program to manage my library easily. I tried Excel but it is not the easiest way.
I am currently studying the C, so I began to code Library_Comics. 

***What it looks like ?*** (for the moment)

    |======================|

    MENU
    ====
    
    1 - show : Show the library
    2 - details : Show one comic book
    3 - add : Add one book to the library
    4 - remove : Remove one book to the library
    5 - modify : Modify one comic book
    0 - quit : Exit the program
    
    What do you want to do ? 

***Actual features :*** 

- There is a unique Library
- all the comics functions are implemented
    - create a comics and add it to the library
    - modify a comics (its title, author, editor, rate, status, comments)
    - delete a comics

***Future features :*** 

- Possibility to create as many Libraries as we want (like shelves and organize them better)
- Implement a way to save the actual library, so we can load it and have an historical of this if we want.
- Create a GUI (let's face it : this thing will not come next week :p )

Thank you for reading. If you have a comment don't be shy ;)
